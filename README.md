## A webpage with a canvas that behaves like an Etch-A-Sketch

The idea for this project was a provided by "The Odin Project" curriculum.
The webpage contains a square grid "canvas" split into user-specified dimensions. Each section of the grid starts out translucent and gets progressive more opaque the more times the mouse enters the same square. It takes 5 interactions to make a section of the grid fully opaque.

There are two buttons:
1. Resize grid - Prompts the user to input a grid size and creates a new grid inside the canvas. Also erases the colors from the previous grid.
2. Reset grid - Erases the current canvas colors without resizing.

And two checkboxes:
1. Randomize colors - The mouse colors each square it enters a new randomly generated color as opposed to the default black.

2. Borders - Toggles borders of the the grid squares on/off.
